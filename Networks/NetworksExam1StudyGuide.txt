## Bitmap protocol
	# Each station represents a bit on a bitmap and it's used to eliminate collisions slide 24

## Hidden Terminal
	# Wireless stations send data to the same middle station but the radio range is not long enough for both
	# transmitting stations to see the other sending a transmission.

## Classic ethernet
	# Preamble
	# SoF (Start of Frame)
	# Destination Address
	# Source Address
	# Type
	# Data
	# Pad
	# Checksum

## CSMA 1-persistent
	# CS - Carrier Sense means they can see when the channel is busy
	# When the channel is not busy, wait a random time, then send again
	# if collision is detected, wait a random time, then send again

## Hub transmits to the entire network (connected to it)
## Switch transmits to the target MAC address

## Network layer -> handles routing

## Flooding algorithm
	# Like a hub but for routing
	# hop counter keeps from infinite loops

## Distance Vector Routing - uses Dijkstra's Algorithm and __TABLE__

## IP Address
	# 32 bits
