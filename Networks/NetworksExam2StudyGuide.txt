*** Course 6 - Medium Access Control Sublayer ***

# Data Transmission Models
	## Channel Allocation Problem
		### Static Channel Allocation
			#### Uneven data traffic
			#### Performance affected when peak traffic to mean traffic ratios are 1000:1
			#### Most channels will be idle
		### Dynamic Channel Allocation
			#### Independent traffic
				##### independent stations have a program that generates a fram and then transmits it
			#### Single Channel
				##### Only 1 channel for all communication
			#### Observable collisions
				##### if 2 frames are transmitted at the same time, they overlab and the signal is messed up
				##### this is called a collision
				##### all stations can detect that a collistion has occurred
			#### Continuous or slotted time
				##### continuous means it can occur at any moment
				##### slotted means at discrete intervals (can only begin at the start of a slot)
			### Carrier sense
				##### station can tell if the channel is in use before trying to use it
				##### senses a frame being carried through the channel

# Multiple Access Protocols
	## ALOHA
		### Each node transmits whenever they need
		### if collision occurs, the station tries again after some time, until the frame is transmitted successfully
		### Pure ALOHA
			#### Continuous transmission
		### Slotted ALOHA
			#### Slotted transmission
			#### Time slot synchro can be achieved by one special station emitting a pip at each slot
	## Carrier Sense Multiple Access
		### Persistent and nonpersistent
			#### 1-persistent CSMA
				##### high chance of collisions
				##### sense and transmit
			#### nonpersistent CSMA
				##### check-wait-check-wait-check-transmit
			#### p-persistent CSMA
				#### 1-persistent but transmit at intervals with probability 'p'
		### CSMA with collision detection
			#### Basis of Ethernet LAN
			#### Listen while sending
			#### if collision is occuring it is a contention period
			#### a wait of 2T is necessary to detect collisions
			#### after 2T, the station is occupying the channel
	## Collision-Free Protocols
		### Bit-map protocol
			#### Each station represents a bit on the bitmap
			#### the earlier station in the bitmap will have "reservation"
			#### stations queue up to transmit data
			#### no risk of collisions
		### Token passing
			#### a token is sent around (circle) to all stations in a predefined order
			#### only the station that has the token can transmit data
			#### if it doesn't need to transmit, it passes on the token to the next station
		### Binary countdown
			#### prior-mentioned protocols do not scale well for a lot of stations
			#### during contention each station broadcasts each unique address
			#### transmission is done in priority of highest number (OR gate)
	## Limited-Contention Protocols
		### light load means contention protocols are preferable
		### heavy load means collision-free is preferable
		### these are symmetric meaning each station tries to acquire the channel with the same probability
		### Limited-Contents protocols are asymmetric
		### Adaptive Tree Walk Protocol
			#### if collision occurs, in the next contention slot the same algorithm is considered for the tree with root 2
			#### this continues exponentially
	## Wireless LAN protocols
		### Radio Range needs to be considered
		### Hidden Terminal problem
			#### 2 stations try to transmit to the same station but can't detect the other
			#### this is because they are outside of eachothers range
			#### this causes a collision
		### Exposed Terminal problem
			#### if two stations try to transmit to other stations, but are close together
			#### they will sense the other trying to transmit and falsely conclude that they cannot transmit
		### Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA)
			#### Sender makes receivers output a short frame
			#### other stations will detect this and avoid transmitting
			#### Sender sends RTS (Request To Send)
			#### Receiver sends CTS (Clear To Send)
# Ethernet
	## Classic Ethernet
		### larger networks use repeaters to amplify signals
		### DIX standard frame format
			#### Preamble
			#### Destination Address
			#### Source Address
			#### Type
			#### Data
			#### Pad
			#### Checksum
		### Ethernet IEE 802.3
			#### Preamble
			#### SoF
			#### Destination Address
			#### Source Address 
			#### Length
			#### Data
			#### Pad
			#### Checksum
		### minimum frame size must be greater than 2T
		### A will be alerted that a collision occurred
		### Classic Ethernet is hard to maintain
	## Switched Ethernet
		### A hub sends out received messages on all lines except the sender
		### A switch sends out received messages to their specific destination (MAC Address)

# Wireless LAN (802.11)
	## Architecture and Protocol Stack
		### Infrastructure mode
			#### Uses an Access Point to transmit between systems
			#### Several APs form a distribution system
		### ADO-HOC mode
			#### Computers send frames directly to eachother
	## Physical layer
		### 802.11 -> remote controls in the 2.4 GHz band
		### 802.11a -> OFDM in the 5 GHz
		### 802.11b -> 1-2 Mbps extended to 11 Mbps
		### 802.11g -> like 802.11a but in the 2.4 GHz band allowing up to 54 Mbps
		### 802.11n -> up to 600 Mbps
		### 802.11ax -> up to 9.6Gbps
	## MAC Sublayer Protocol
		### collision protocols for ethernet do not work
		### CSMA with Collision Avoidance
			#### Sender waits random time and sends (if idle) and waits for acknowledgement
			#### if no acknowledgement, wait a random time and send again
			#### Hidden Terminal and Exposed Terminal come into play here
				##### Each frame contains a NAV that is a set time
				##### during NAV the station will refrain from sending
	## Frame Structure
		### Frame Control
		### Duration
		### Address 1 (recipient)
		### Address 2 (transmitter)
		### Address 3
		### Sequence
		### Data
		### Check Sequence
	## Services
		### Association
			#### upon arriving within range of an AP, A station gets information from the AP
			#### Beacon frames or direct request
			#### includes capabilities and Identity
		### Reassociation
			#### Changes a station's preferred AP
		### Authentication
			#### WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
				##### Authentication with a preshared key
				##### Easy to compromise
				##### before association
			#### WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access 2)
				##### authentication server with database of users
				##### verifies authentication credentials of a station
				##### After association
		### Distribution
			#### How to route frames that reach the AP
		### Integration
			#### any translation to be sent outside the 802.11 LAN
			#### any translation to be received from outside the 802.11 LAN
		### Data Delivery
			#### transmit and receive data
			#### higher layers must deal with detecting and correcting errors
		### Privacy
			#### Encryption and Decryption
			#### WPA2 is based on AES - Advanced Encryption Standard
			#### AES keys are determined during the authentication procedure
		### QOS traffic scheduling
			#### voice and video traffic receive preferential treatment

# Data Link Layer Switching
	## Bridges
		### Used to join LANs together
		### Trunk
		### Need to have a hash table with all destinations
		### Bridges learn with time (backward learning)
		### Routing procedure
			#### if source and destination are the same, discard
			#### if they are different, send to destination
			#### if destination is unknown, use flooding
			#### MAC address is early in the fram so the bridge can disregard fast
				##### cut-through switching or wormhole routing
	## Virtual LANs
		### Security
			#### Separate things based on purpose and security needs
		### Load
			#### Some have heavier usage
		### Broadcast traffic
		### VLANs
			#### separate LANs entirely in software
		### 802.1Q contains VLAN Identifier

*** Course 7 - Network Layer ***

# Network Layer
	### Data Link moves frames from one end of the wire to the other
	### Network Layer handles routing

# Connectionless service
	## Packets are routed independently of each other
	## Packets = datagrams
	## Network is called a datagram network
		### no circuit setup
		### full source and destination
		### do not hold state information about connections
		### each packet is independent of another
		### no effect from router failures except lost packets
		### difficult to service
		### difficult congestion control

# Connection-Oriented service
	## path is determined before sending
	## this is a virtual circuit
		### Circuit setup is required
		### each packet contains a short VC number
		### Each VC needs the router table space
		### Route chosen when VC is set up
		### All VCs that pass through a failed router are terminated
		### easy to service
		### easy to control congestion

# Routing Algorithms
	## nonadaptive (static) algorithms
		### routes are computed in advance and downloaded when the network is booted
	## Adaptive (dynamic) algorithms
		### change their routing to reflect changes in the topology
	## The optimality principle
		### if a router is on the optimal path between 2 others, 
		### then the path from that router to either of the other ones is optimal

# Routing Algorithms (2)
	## Shortest Path
		### Computes shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm
	## Flooding
		### Every incoming packet goes out to every line aside from the sender
		### A hub does this
	## Distance Vector Routing
		### Uses router tables to determine path
		### if a node is down, all routers consider distance to it as infinite
		### when the node comes back up, all nodes communicate it's return (Good news propagation is fast)
		### Bad news propagation -> all routers must set distance to infinity with routes being rapidly updated (counting)
	## Link State Routing
		### Replaced Distance Vector
			#### Discover neighbours + addresses
			#### Set distance/Cost
			#### put info in packet
			#### Send packet and receive all other packets from other routers
			#### compute shortest path to all other routers
